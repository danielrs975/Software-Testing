# Project Title

Using testing to solve 4 problems

## Description

Four problem are presented here that are solve using testing to drive the implementation of
the solution. The problems are:
- "Simple" Unit Test: Testing a function that calculate the average of two numbers
- Test first Programming: Implementation of a game called "Matches" using TDD (Test driven development)
- Equivalence Classes - Line Overlap: Implemenation of a problem solution with TDD
- Invariants: Implementation of state checker function to see if a given state is consistent through the evaluation of the invariants.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The program is written in Javascript and run with NodeJS (v13.9.0). The tests
are run with Jest (v25.1.0).

To run this software you have to have installed:
- NodeJS [Install it here](https://nodejs.org/es/download/)

### Installing

To set up this software in a local environment.

- First download the [repository](https://github.com/danielrs975/Software-Testing)
- Unzip the file downloaded inside a folder.
- Open a terminal and go to the folder you put the repository.
- Inside of the root of the repository run: ```npm install``` to install the dependecies of the project
- When the installation is finished you can run the tests.

## Running the tests

We have four different problems each one with its test set. You have to run in the terminal, for each problem,
the following: 
- For the first problem you run: ```npm run test:problem_one```
- For the second problem you run: ```npm run test:problem_two```
- For the third problem you run: ```npm run test:problem_three```
- For the fourth problem you run: ```npm run test:problem_four```

## Built With

```
Javascript through NodeJS v13.9.0

```
